Introduction {#intro}
============

The C++20 formatting facility (`std::format`) allows formatting of `char` as an
integer via format specifiers such as `d` and `x`. Unfortunately [[P0645]] that
introduced the facility didn't take into account that signedness of `char` is
implementation-defined and specified this formatting in terms of `to_chars`
with the value implicitly converted (promoted) to `int`. This had some
undesirable effects discovered after getting usage experience and resolved in
the {fmt} library ([[FMT]]). This paper proposes applying a similar fix to
`std::format`.

First, `std::format` normally produces consistent output across platforms for
the same integral types and the same IEEE 754 floating point types. Formatting
`char` as an integer breaks this nice property making the output
implementation-defined even if the `char` size is effectively the same.

Second, `char` is used as a code unit type in `std::format` and other text
processing facilities. In these use cases one normally needs to either output
`char` as (a part of) text which is the default or as a bit pattern. Having it
sometimes be output as a signed integer is surprising to users. It is
particularly surprising when formatted in a non-decimal base. For example,
assuming UTF-8 literal encoding:

```c++
for (char c : std::string("ðŸ¤·")) {
  std::print("\\x{:02x}", c);
}
```

will print either

```
\xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7
```

or 

```
\x-10\x-61\x-5c\x-49
```

depending on a platform. Since it is implementation-defined, the user may not
even be aware of this issue which can then manifest itself when the code is
compiled and run on a different platform or with different compiler flags.

This particular case can be fixed by adding a cast to `unsigned char` but it
may not be as easy to do when formatting ranges compared to using format
specifiers.

Proposal {#proposal}
========

This paper proposes making code unit types formatted as unsigned integers
instead of implementation-defined.

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Code
  <th>Before
  <th>After
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
```
// Assuming UTF-8 as a literal encoding.
for (char c : std::string("ðŸ¤·")) {
  std::print("\\x{:02x}", c);
}
```
<td>
```
\xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7
```
or

```
\x-10\x-61\x-5c\x-49
```
(implementation-defined)
<td>
```text
\xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7
```
</tr>
</table>

Wording {#wording}
=======

Change in [[tab:format.type.char](
http://eel.is/c++draft/format#tab:format.type.char)]:

Table 69: Meaning of type options for `charT`â€ƒ[tab:format.type.char]

<table>
<tr>
  <td>Type
  <td>Meaning
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>none, `c`
  <td>Copies the character to the output.
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`b`, `B`, `d`, `o`, `x`, `X`
  <td>As specified in Table 68<ins> with `value` converted to the corresponding unsigned type</ins>.
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`?`
  <td>Copies the escaped character ([format.string.escaped]) to the output.
</tr>
</table>

Impact on existing code {#impact}
=======================

This is a breaking change but the it only affects the output of negative/large
code units when output via opt-in format specifiers. There were no issues
reported when the change was shipped in {fmt} and the number of uses of
`std::format` is orders of magnitude smaller at the moment.

Implementation {#impl}
==============

The proposed change has been implemented in the {fmt} library ([[FMT]]).
