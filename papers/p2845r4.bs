Introduction {#intro}
============

[[P1636]] "Formatters for library types" proposed adding a number of
`std::formatter` specializations, including the one for `std::filesystem::path`.
However, SG16 recommended removing it because of quoting and localization
concerns. The current paper addresses these concerns and proposes adding an
improved `std::formatter` specialization for `path`.

Changes from R3 {#changes2}
===============

* Added SG16 Poll Results.

Changes from R2 {#changes2}
===============

* Added missing `:?` to the escaping example in [Proposal](#proposal).

* Changed the wording around the escaping example to not mention hexadecimal
    escapes since Unicode escapes may be produced as well.

Changes from R1 {#changes1}
===============

* Provided control over escaping via format specifiers per SG16 feedback.

Changes from R0 {#changes0}
===============

* Added a reference to [[format.string](http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string)]
    for the productions <i>fill-and-align</i> and <i>width</i>.

* Replaced *range-format-spec* with *path-format-spec* in the *Effects* clause
    of the `format` function.

* Added missing transcoding to the definition of the `format` function.

SG16 Poll Results {#poll-results}
=================

**POLL**: Forward P2845R2, Formatting of` std::filesystem::path`, to LEWG with a 
ecommended target of C++26.

<table class="poll">
<tr>
  <th>SF

  <th>N
  <th>A
  <th>SA

<tr>
  <td>5
  <td>2

**Outcome**: Strong consensus.

(The poll states P2845R2, but the revision of the paper that was reviewed was a
draft of P2845R3 that addressed some minor issues.)

Problems {#problems}
========

[[P1636]] proposed defining a `formatter` specialization for `path` in terms
of the `ostream` insertion operator which, in turn, formats the native
representation wrapped in `quoted`. For example:

```c++
std::cout << std::format("{}", std::filesystem::path("/usr/bin"));
```

would print `"/usr/bin"` with quotes being part of the output.

Unfortunately this has a number of problems, some of them raised in the LWG
discussion of the paper.

First, `std::quoted` only escapes the delimiter (`"`) and the escape character
itself (<code>\</code>). As a result the output may not be usable if the path
contains control characters such as newlines. For example:

```c++
std::cout << std::format("{}", std::filesystem::path("multi\nline"));
```

would print

```text
"multi
line"
```

which is not a valid string in C++ and many other languages, most importantly
including shell languages. Such output is pretty much unusable and
interferes with formatting of ranges of paths.

Another problem is encoding. The `native` member function returns
`basic_string<value_type>` where

> `value_type` is a `typedef` for the operating system dependent encoded
> character type used to represent pathnames.

`value_type` is normally `char` on POSIX and `wchar_t` on Windows.

This function may perform encoding conversion per [[fs.path.type.cvt](
http://eel.is/c++draft/fs.path.type.cvt)].

On POSIX, when the target code unit type is `char` no conversion is normally
performed:

> For POSIX-based operating systems `path::value_type` is `char` so no
> conversion from `char` value type arguments or to `char` value type return
> values is performed.

This usually gives the desired result.

On Windows, when the target code unit type is `char` the encoding conversion
would result in invalid output. For example, trying to print the following path
in Belarusian

```c++
std::print("{}\n", std::filesystem::path(L"Шчучыншчына"));
```

would result in the following output in the Windows console even though all code
pages and localization settings are set to Belarusian and both the source and
literal encodings are UTF-8:

```
"�����������"
```

The problem is that despite `print` and `path` both support Unicode the
intermediate conversion goes through CP1251 (the code page used for Belarusian)
which is not even valid for printing in the console which uses legacy CP866.
This has been discussed at length in [[P2093]] "Formatted output".

Proposal {#proposal}
========

Both of the problems discussed in the previoius section have already been
solved. The escaping mechanism that can handle invalid code units has been
introduced in [[P2286]] "Formatting Ranges" and encoding issues have been
addressed in [[P2093]] and other papers. We apply those solutions to the
formatting of paths.

<!-- if necessary for transcoding -->
This paper proposes adding a `formatter` specialization for `path` that does
escaping similarly to [[P2286]] and Unicode transcoding on Windows.
Additionally, it proposes giving the user control over escaping via format
specifiers. The debug format (`?`) gives the escaped representation while the
default is unescaped and minimally processed with only invalid code units
substituted with replacement characters if necessary. This is consistent with
formatting of strings. The default format can be useful for displaying paths in
a UI and gives the user control whether and how to handle special characters.
The debug format is useful for displaying paths as parts of a larger structure
such as a range and prevents interferring with its formatting.

</table>

This leaves only one question of how to handle invalid Unicode. Plain strings
handle them by formatting ill-formed code units as hexadecimal escapes, e.g.

```c++
// invalid UTF-8, s has value: ["\x{c3}("]
std::string s = std::format("[{:?}]", "\xc3\x28");
```

This is useful because it doesn't loose any information. But in case of paths
it is a bit more complicated because the string is in a different form and
the mapping between ill-formed code units in one form to another may not be
well-defined.

When escaping, the current paper proposes applying it to the original ill-formed
data because it gives more intuitive result and doesn't require non-standard
mappings such as WTF-8 ([[WTF]]).

For example:
```c++
auto p = std::filesystem::path(L"\xd800"); // a lone surrogate
std::print("{:?}\n", p);
```
prints
```text
"\u{d800}"
```

When not escaping, the paper proposes substituting invalid code units with
replacement characters which is the recommended Unicode practice
([[UNICODE-SUB]]):

For example:
```c++
auto p = std::filesystem::path(L"\xd800"); // a lone surrogate
std::print("{}\n", p);
```
prints
```text
�
```

Wording {#wording}
=======

Add to "Header &lt;filesystem> synopsis" [[fs.filesystem.syn](
https://eel.is/c++draft/fs.filesystem.syn)]:

```
// [fs.path.fmt], formatter
template<class charT> struct formatter<filesystem::path, charT>;
```

Add a new section "Formatting" [fs.path.fmt] under "Class path"
[[fs.class.path](https://eel.is/c++draft/fs.class.path)]:

<pre>
template&lt;class charT> struct formatter&lt;filesystem::path, charT> {
  constexpr format_parse_context::iterator parse(format_parse_context& ctx);

  template&lt;class FormatContext>
    typename FormatContext::iterator
      format(const filesystem::path& path, FormatContext& ctx) const;
};
</pre>

`formatter<filesystem::path, charT>` is *debug-enabled*
([[format.formatter.spec](http://eel.is/c++draft/format.formatter.spec)]).

```
constexpr format_parse_context::iterator parse(format_parse_context& ctx);
```

*Effects*: Parses the format specifier as a *path-format-spec* and stores the
parsed specifiers in `*this`.

<i>path-format-spec</i>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>fill-and-align<sub>opt</sub></i> <i>width<sub>opt</sub></i> <code>?</code><i><sub>opt</sub></i>

where the productions <i>fill-and-align</i> and <i>width</i> are described in
[[format.string](http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string)].

*Returns*: An iterator past the end of the *path-format-spec*.

<pre>
  template&lt;class FormatContext>
    typename FormatContext::iterator
      format(const filesystem::path& p, FormatContext& ctx) const;
</pre>

*Effects*: Let `s` be

* `p.native()` escaped per [[format.string.escaped](
    http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.escaped)] if `?` is specified, or
* `p.native()` otherwise.

Writes `s` into `ctx.out()`, adjusted according to the *path-format-spec*.
If `Char` is `char`, `path::value_type` is `wchar_t` and the literal encoding
is UTF-8 then the escaped path is transcoded from the native encoding for wide
character strings to UTF-8 with invalid code units substituted with U+FFFD
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER per the Unicode Standard, Chapter 3.9 U+FFFD Substitution
in Conversion.
If `Char` and `path::value_type` are the same then no transcoding is performed.
Otherwise, transcoding is implementation-defined.

*Returns*: An iterator past the end of the output range.

Implementation {#impl}
==============

The proposed `formatter` for `std::filesystem::path` has been implemented in the
open-source {fmt} library ([[FMT]]).
