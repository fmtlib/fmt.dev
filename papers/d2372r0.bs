The problem {#prob}
===========

In C++20 "Extending `<chrono>` to Calendars and Time Zones" ([[P0355]]) and
"Text Formatting" ([[P0645]]) proposals were integrated ([[P1361]]).
Unfortunately during this integration a design issue was missed: `std::format`
is locale-independent by default and provides control over locale via format
specifiers but the new formatter specializations for chrono types are localized
by default and don't provide such control.

For example:

```c++
  std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU"));
  std::string s1 = std::format("{}", 4.2);         // s1 == "4.2" (not localized)
  std::string s2 = std::format("{:L}", 4.2);       // s2 == "4,2" (localized)
  using sec = std::chrono::duration<double>;
  std::string s3 = std::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2)); // s3 == "04,200" (localized)
```

In addition to being inconsistent with the design of `std::format`, there is no
way to avoid locale other than doing formatting of date and time components
manually.

This issue has been reported in [[LWG3547]].

We propose fixing it by making chrono formatters locale-independent by default
and providing the `L` specifier to opt into localized formatting in the same way
as it is done for all other standard formatters
([format.string.std](https://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std)).

Non locale-dependant specifiers
===============================

Some specifiers (`%d %H %I %m %M %S %u %w %y %z`) produce digits
which are not localized (aka they use the arabic numerals `0123456789`).
They have an equivalent form (`%Od %OH %OI %Om %OM %OS %Ou %Ow %Oy %Oz`)
where the numerals can be localized. for example Japanese numerals
`〇 一 二 三 四 五 ...` can be used as the "alternative representation" by a `ja_JP` locale,

But because the `L` option applies to all specifiers,
we do not propose to modify the specifiers.

For example, `"{:L%p%I}"` and `"{:L%p%OI}"` should be valid specifiers producing
`午後一` and `午後1` respectiveely.

Appropriate use of numeral systems for localized numbers and dates
requires more work, this paper focuses on consistent default behavior.


"C" locale
========

The "C" locale is used in the wording as a way to express locale-independent behavior.
The C standard specifies the "C" locale behavior for strftime as follow

<blockquote>


In the "C" locale, the E and O modifiers are ignored
and the replacement strings for the following specifiers are:


<pre>

%a the first three characters of %A.
%A one of ''Sunday'', ''Monday'', ... , ''Saturday''.
%b the first three characters of %B.
%B one of ''January'', ''February'', ... , ''December''.
%c equivalent to ''%a %b %e %T %Y''.
%p one of ''AM'' or ''PM''.
%r equivalent to ''%I:%M:%S %p''.
%x equivalent to ''%m/%d/%y''.
%X equivalent to %T.
%Z implementation-defined.

</pre>
</blockquote>


SG16 polls {#polls}
==========

[[LWG3547]] has been discussed at a SG16 telecon and there was a strong
consensus to fix the issue.

  <th>SF
  <th>F
  <th>N
  <th>A
  <th>SA
</th>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>

Implementation experience {#impl}
=========================

The `L` specifier has been implemented for durations in the fmt library ([[FMT]]).
Additionally, some format specifiers like `S` have never used a locale by default
so this was a novel behavior accidentally introduced in C++20:

```
std::locale::global(std::locale("ru_RU"));
using sec = std::chrono::duration<double>;
std::string s = fmt::format("{:%S}", sec(4.2)); // s == "04.200" (not localized)
```

Impact on existing code {#impact}
=======================

Changing the semantics of chrono formatters to be consistent with standard
format specifiers ([format.string.std](https://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std))
is a breaking change. At the time of writing none of the standard libraries
shipped the С++20 formatting facility and therefore there is no code using it.
However, Microsoft's STL implementation is close to shipping.

Wording {#wording}
=======

All wording is relative to the C++ working draft [[N4885]].

Update the value of the feature-testing macro `__cpp_lib_format` to the date of
adoption in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/n4885.pdf#page=500">[version.syn]</a>:

2 Each conversion specifier *conversion-spec* is replaced by appropriate
characters as described in Table [tab:time.format.spec]; the formats specified
in ISO 8601:2004 shall be used where so described. Some of the conversion
specifiers depend on <del>the locale that is passed to the formatting function if the
latter takes one, or the global locale otherwise.</del> <ins> a locale. If the *L* option is
used, that locale is the locale that is passed to the formatting function if the
latter takes one, or the global locale otherwise. If the *L* option is not used,
that locale is the "C" locale.</ins> If the formatted object does not contain the
information the conversion specifier refers to, an exception of type
`format_error` is thrown.
