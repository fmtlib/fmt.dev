# Discussion

To prevent mojibake `std::print` may use a native Unicode API when writing to
a terminal bypassing the stream buffer. During the review of [[P2093]] Formatted
output Tim Song suggested that synchronizing `std::print` with the underlying
stream may be beneficial for gradual adoption. This paper discusses the two
options.

Consider the following example:

```c++
printf("first\n");
std::print("second\n");
```

This will produce the expected output:

```
first
second
```

because `stdout` is line buffered by default.

However, this may reorder the output:

```c++
printf("first");
std::print("second");
```

because of buffering in `printf` but not `std::print`.

It is possible to prevent reordering by flushing the buffer before writing to a
terminal in `std::print` making this case less surprising. This will incur
additional cost but only for the terminal transcoding case.

Neither {fmt} ([[FMT]]) nor Rust ([[RUST-STDIO]]) do such synchronization in
their implementations of `print`.
