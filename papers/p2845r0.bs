Introduction {#intro}
============

[[P1636]] "Formatters for library types" proposed adding a number of
`std::formatter` specializations, including the one for `std::filesystem::path`.
However, SG16 recommended removing it because of quoting and localization
concerns. The current paper addresses these concerns and proposes adding an
improved `std::formatter` specialization for `path`.

Problems
========

[[P1636]] proposed defining a `formatter` specialization for `path` in terms
of the `ostream` insertion operator which, in turn, formats the native
representation wrapped in `quoted`. For example:

```c++
std::cout << std::format("{}, std::filesystem:::path("/usr/bin"));
```
would print `"/usr/bin"` with quotes being part of the output.

Unfortunately this has a number of problems, some of them raised in the LWG
discussion of the paper.

First, `std::quoted` only escapes the delimiter (`"`) and the escape character
itself (<code>\</code>). As a result the output may not be usable if the path contains
control characters such as newlines. For example:

```c++
std::cout << std::format("{}, std::filesystem:::path("multi\nline"));
```
would print
```text
"multi
line"
```
which is not a valid string in C++ and many other languages, most importantly
including shell languages. Such output is pretty much unusable and
interferes with formatting of ranges of paths.

Another problem is encoding. The `native` member function returns
`basic_string<value_type>` where

> `value_type` is a `typedef` for the operating system dependent encoded
> character type used to represent pathnames.

`value_type` is normally `char` on POSIX and `wchar_t` on Windows.

This function may perform encoding conversion per [[fs.path.type.cvt](
http://eel.is/c++draft/fs.path.type.cvt)].

On POSIX, when the target code unit type is `char` no conversion is normally
performed:

> For POSIX-based operating systems `path::value_type` is `char` so no
> conversion from `char` value type arguments or to `char` value type return
> values is performed.

This usually gives the desired result.

On Windows, when the target code unit type is `char` the encoding conversion
would result in invalid output. For example, trying to print the following path
in Belarusian

```c++
std::print("{}\n", std::filesystem::path(L"Шчучыншчына"));
```

would result in the following output in the Windows console even though all code
pages and localization settings are set to Belarusian and both the source and
literal encodings are UTF-8:

```
"�����������"
```

The problem is that despite `print` and `path` both support Unicode the
intermediate conversion goes through CP1251 (the code page used for Belarusian)
which is not even valid for printing in the console which uses legacy CP866.
This has been discussed at length in [[P2093]] "Formatted output".

Proposal
========

Fortunately both of the problems discussed in the previoius section have
already been solved. The escaping mechanism has been introduced in [[P2286]]
"Formatting Ranges" and encoding issues have been addressed in [[P2093]] and
other papers. We apply those solutions to the formatting of paths.

This paper proposes adding a `formatter` specialization for `path` that does
escaping similarly to [[P2286]] and Unicode transcoding on Windows.
